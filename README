/**
 * KloutServices is a wrapper class around the Klout (www.klout.com) Web Services API.
 * Documentation of the API is available from developer.klout.com.  Registration for, or
 * availability of, an API key from Mashery/Klout is required to use this class.  The author
 * is not affiliated with Klout in any way.
 * 
 * KloutServices includes a public inner class called KloutUser.  This class
 * is populated with the information returned by web calls to the Klout API.
 * Currently, only the User method (developer.klout.com/iodocs) is implemented.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * You must pass your API key when instantiating a new instance of KloutServices
 * <code>KloutServices klout = new KloutServices('xxxxxxxxxxxxxx');</code>
 *
 * To just get a Klout score based on a Twitter handle:
 * <code>Decimal score = klout.getKlout('jesseendo');</code>
 *
 * To get an entire User Profile returned, as a KloutUser object:
 * <code> KloutUser me = klout.getUserProfile('jesseendo');</code> 
 *
 * To get a List of User Profiles, as a List of KloutUser objects:
 * <code> List<KloutUser> us = klout.getUserProfiles(String[] {'jesseendo', 'benioff');</code>
